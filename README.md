# Getting started:

### Starting the services:
```sh
# clone the app to your machine.
# run those at the root dir of the app.

docker-compose up -d database
docker-compose up -d web
```

### How to test the app
```
localhost:3001
```

#### TODOs?
* use angular to consume the service
* enhance ui and populate weather data in a well shaped ui
